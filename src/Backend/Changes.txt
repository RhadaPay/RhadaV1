Here are the major changes and rationale:

Solidity:
-- Removed unneccessary getters:
  You can just call 
  
  const job = await factory.jobs(jobId);
  job.amount // etc...
  
  Instead of using getters.

-- Added getters for total arrays
  Dynamic arrays are not retrivable by default in solidity, so we have 
  to write getters for them, added for jobs and eventstreams

-- Made Jobs have only a single eventStreamId
  I was having to write dozens of extra lines of code to deal with the Nested
  array, so to save on time, I've just created a single uint eventStreamId to be
  associated with the job. See this as a temp measure.

-- Made jobs instantiate an eventStreamId on creation
  Every job now needs an eventStreamId, this also massively saves on code needed
  to handle null checks.

-- changed 'eventsRemainder' to 'numberOfEvents'
  Log the total number of events recorded against the job, makes it easier
  to check when the next refresh should be.


-- CIDs are not added when creating eventStreams
  this allows us to create an eventStream then add events as they appear.
  Otherwise, we will have to point to a potentially non-existant CID



Folder Structure:
-- Config: Changed the hardhat config to point at the correct folder
-- Nested folder removed: removed a folder that was causing test slowdown

Tests:
-- I added tests for EventStream and Job


Static Typings:
-- I added typescript and typechain support, you don't need to use it if
you don't want but it saves a lot of time by adding autosuggestions.
You can still use .js files in the same project.

-- If you do want to use typescript, you can just run "npx hardhat typechain" and
the contract will be compiled and typed so VS code can provide autosuggestions
